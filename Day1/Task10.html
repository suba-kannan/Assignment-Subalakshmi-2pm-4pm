      <h1>The Road Not Taken</h1>

      <p>
        Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,<br/>
        And sorry I could not travel both,<br/>
        And be one traveler, long I stood,<br/>
        And looked down one as far as I could,<br/>
        To where it bent in the undergrowth.<br/><br/>

        I took the one less traveled by,<br/>
        And that has made all the difference.
      </p>
