// Practice Tasks:
//Task-1:

console.log("My name is Suba");

//Task-2:

// Write two single-line comments in JS

// Task-3:

/*Lorem" is the first word of "Lorem Ipsum," 
a common placeholder text in design and publishing. 
It is a scrambled, nonsensical version of a 1st-century BC 
Latin text by Cicero, with "lorem" being a shortened form of "dolorem" 
(pain). The text has no real meaning in its current form and is used to 
demonstrate visual layouts without being a distraction. */

console.log("External script file loaded successfully!");

//Task -5:

//Task 4 and 5 are same.
