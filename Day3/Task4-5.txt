4. Write down 2 benefits of using semantic tags.

1. Semantic tags make the structure of a webpage more meaningful and easier to understand for both developers and browsers.
2. They improve readability, accessibility and SEO by helping screen readers and search engines recognize the purpose of each section.


5. Compare semantic tags with <div> — when should each be used?

Semantic Tags:

Semantic tags like <header>, <nav>, <main>, <section>, <article>, and <footer> describe the meaning and purpose of the content they contain.
Uses: Use semantic tags when your content has a specific role in the webpage structure such as navigation menus, page sections or articles because they improve accessibility, SEO, and readability.

<div> (Non-Semantic Tag):

A <div> does not describe the meaning of the content. It is only a box used to group elements.
Uses: Use <div> when you need a generic container for styling with CSS, layout purposes or when no semantic tag matches the content.
